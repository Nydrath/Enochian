-I omitted separating syllables with - if it wasn't between two vowels you might otherwise be tempted to combine (eg. "ds" = di-es)
-I chose to use vaoan and not vooan
-"abramg" is written to be pronounced "a-bramg", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "abramj"
-"ooge" you would expect to be pronounced "uj", but Laycock writes it as "õ-ge". It seems Dee has written it "oögé", which leads me to believe Laycock was right.
-words beginning with u (urelp, urbs) were written with a prefix y (as "yurelp")
-Laycock made a mistake in transcription, in the third call, 8th word, is biab, not biah.
-Laycock made a mistake in transcription, in the third call, 24th word, is "chis i", not "chisi"
-"balzarg" is written to be pronounced "bal-zarg", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "balzarj"
-"caosg" is written to be pronounced "kaozg", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "kaozj"
-"dooain" (end of third call) is dissected as "do-o-ain" by Laycock, but Dee splits it even further, all the way to "do-o-a-in". I will use the latter.
-"uniglag" is written to be pronounced "u-nig-lag", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "uniglaj"
-No indication is given on how to pronounce "PD" (33). I assumed the same as "P" and "D" individually (Pidi), which incidentally is also how one would in english.
-No indication is given for "MAPM" either. I went entirely on a hunch and assumed "mapëm".
-"ag" is written to be pronounced "ag", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "aj"
-No pronounciation or entry was found for "lo", appearing as the 39th word of the 4th call. Nor was any found for "talo", which given Dee's text, could have made sense. Assumed pronounced as written.
-No pronounciation or entry was found for "amipzi", appearing as the 18th word of the 5th call. It looks almost identical to amizpi, but Dee also writes it "amipzi". The existence of the crowley word "ameipezodi" and the nonexistence of "amizpi" anywhere in the calls make me suspect this was a mistake of Laycock's, though. Either way assuming pronounced as written.
-"naz arth" in the 5th call is a single word, "nazarth".
-Laycock made a mistake in transcription, in the fifth call, 23rd word, is zizop, not ziziop.
-Laycock made a mistake in transcription, in the sixth call, first word, is Gah, not Gar.
-First word of eighth call is written "Bazm elo", but in Dee's book it is as one word, "Bazmelo". This wouldn't change any pronounciation, but Laycock even inserts a comma between, which implies a pause I'm not sure there should be.
-Laycock made a mistake in transcription, in the eighth call, 14th word, is abramg, not abramig.
-"abramg" is written to be pronounced "a-bramg", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "abramj"
-"abramig" is written to be pronounced "a-bram-ig", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "abramij"
-"loncho" is written to be pronounced "lon-cho", but ch's in the middle of words are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "k". So I am using "lonko"
-No pronounciation or entry was found for "Iado", appearing as the 58th word of the 8th call. Assumed pronounciation was "Yado".
-No pronounciation or entry was found for "CIAL", appearing as the 29th word of the 9th call. Assumed pronounciation was "sial".
-No entry at all was found for "zumvi", nor "zum", appearing as 53rd word of the 9th call. Assumed pronounciation as written.
-"Dazis", 55th word of 9th call, is misspelled "daziz".
-"Chis", 62nd word of the 9th call, is misspelled "chi".
-Parentheses are used by Laycock but don't really appear in Dee, at least in the 9th call.
