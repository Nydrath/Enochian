-I omitted separating syllables with - if it wasn't between two vowels you might otherwise be tempted to combine (eg. "ds" = di-es)
-I chose to use vaoan and not vooan
-"abramg" is written to be pronounced "a-bramg", but ending-word g's are pretty explicitly said to be pronounced "j". It also makes more sense. So I am using "abramj"
-"ooge" you would expect to be pronounced "uj", but Laycock writes it as "õ-ge". It seems Dee has written it "oögé", which leads me to believe Laycock was right.
-words beginning with u (urelp, urbs) were written with a prefix y (as "yurelp")
